#### All is as was discussed in class

ADTs
- represent the different ways of organizing data in a computer. 
- each ADt specifies WHAT data is stored and WHAT operations on the data. Not HOW to store and HOW to implement the operations.

Data Structure
- An implementation of an ADT within a programming language.
A data structure is specialized format for organizing, provessing, retrieving and storing data. It is a way to implement an ADT. 
Two types of data structures
1. Stattic data structures
- data is stored in memory and does not change. It is fixed such as the array
2. Dynamic 
- varies in size such as link-list, queue, and stack

Types of DS in most programming languages
- Arrays
- Class/structures
- Strings

Data structures that have to be created
- Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees
- Graphs
- Hash tables
- Recursive


#### 1. Arrays
- An array is the simplest data structure


#### 2. Linked-list


#### 3. Stack


#### 4. Queue


#### 5. Recursive

#### 6. Tree

#### 7. Graph



### Operations in a Data Structure
- Insertion: adding a new record
- Deletion: removing a record
- Search: finding a record or the location of using a key
- Traversing: visiting each record in the data structure at least once


### Combination
- Updating: 
- Sorting:
- Merging: combining two or more data structures into one
